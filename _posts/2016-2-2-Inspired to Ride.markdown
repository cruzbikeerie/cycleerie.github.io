 I watch *Inspired to Ride* at home on my Google Chrome Cast.
 It also available on Amazon and Apple TV.
 This is a almost like RAM except it is self-supported. There is no crew car that give you support. You do the entire race on your own.
 
 It showed why you would have to be crazy to do this race.
 The cyclist bicycles broke, there bodies broke down. hey rode over 300 miles a day with only 2 or 3 hours of sleep.  
 The winner Finnish it in less   over 4000 miles in less then 18 days.

##Below is a quote from the Movie Web site.

> INSPIRED TO RIDE follows a handful of cyclists as they race unsupported in the inaugural year of The Trans Am Bike Race. It's the antithesis to events like Tour de France and Race Across America. There are no teams, no support vehicles, no special jerseys and not a dime in prize money. 

>As they battle lack of sleep, injuries and spirited competition, INSPIRED TO RIDE takes you on an invigorating road trip â€” amidst the jaw-dropping beauty of the TransAmerica Trail with its varied landscapes, intriguing locals and found stories which dot this path of discovery.
