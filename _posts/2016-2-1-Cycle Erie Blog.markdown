# The rides
  The ride will be on Erie County rural low traffic roads. The roads may have up-hill climbs and downhill decents. We may also may  car commute to a local flat bike path. We also might do a bike overnight. Ride to a destination, campout or sleep in a inn or B&B , then ride home the next day. Check out this blog for ride anouncements

# These ride are social rides, not competive.
We will ride to a Country Fair or sit-down Restaurant and talk about the ride and other things. We will always wait for the last person to show up and give him or her a chance to take a break too. If you are a member of the Erie Outing Club,or if you just interested in cycling and meeting new people come and join us. 

# This blog will also contain story's
I will also try to post storys with pictures about the ride. And sometime maybe a You Tube Video about the ride.
