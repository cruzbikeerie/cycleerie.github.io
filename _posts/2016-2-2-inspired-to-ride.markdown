[http://watch.inspiredtoride.it/](http://watch.inspiredtoride.it/)

 I watch *Inspired to Ride* at home on my Google Chrome Cast.
 It also available on Amazon and Apple TV.
 This is a almost like RAM except it is self-supported. There is no crew car that give you support. You do the entire race on your own.
 
 It showed why you would have to be crazy to do this race.
 The cyclist bicycles broke, there bodies broke down. hey rode over 300 miles a day with only 2 or 3 hours of sleep.  
 The winner Finnish it in less   over 4000 miles in less then 18 days.
