# Welcome to the new Cycle Erie Blog.
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>Welcome to the new Cycle Erie. We are Erie Outing Club members 
who like to ride out on rural roads in Erie County. We also do rides in counties and states that borders Erie County</p>

# These ride are social rides, not competive.
We will ride to a Country Fair or sit-down Resturant and talk about the ride and other things.
