# Welcome to the new Cycle Erie Blog.
Welcome to the new Cycle Erie. We are [Erie Outing Club](http://erieoutingclub.github.io/) members 
who like to ride out on rural roads in Erie County. We also do rides in counties and states that borders Erie County.

# These ride are social rides, not competive.
We will ride to a Country Fair or sit-down Restaurant and talk about the ride and other things. We will always wait for the last person to show up and give him or her a chance to take a break too. If you are a member of the Erie Outing Club,or if you just interested in cycling and meeting new people come and join us.
